My formal qualifications are in Mechanical Engineering which included some electrical knowledge and control theory. I spent several years in a Machine Tool company R&D department which involved much electronic equipment and I frequently worked on vibration analysis and the design of structures. This was to become extremely relevant when it came to servo performance issues.

For the last 20 years of my career I specialized in servo systems for a global automation company. I had to specify servo components for industrial automation systems, perform start-ups and trouble shoot. In the early days I wrote my own servo sizing software using GW Basic and was later involved with the other authors in creating a world class sizing and selection tool.
