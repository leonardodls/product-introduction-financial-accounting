After an interest in motors and control from an early age, I obtained an Honours Degree in Engineering specializing in electronics, electric motors, and servos. After specialising as servo design engineer at International Computers developing dynamic peripherals, I took up a European technical sales and support position with Electro-Craft, the leading high performance motor company.  Electro-Craft went on to develop full servo-systems, so I prepared tools for mathematical analysis of dynamic applications to simplify motor selection and optimise mechanics. These tools firstly ran programmable calculators, later pocket PCs as these became available, and finally as full suites for evolving PCs and laptops.  Electro-Craft integrated into Rockwell where I managed the European Motion Control Division, and participated in the motion analysis software development.

Following Rockwell I became an independent consultant for motion control, working with Motion Specialist integrators and OEMs, integrating large numbers of servo-motors in demanding applications.  The Integration was enabled utilizing the advanced motion analysis software that I continued be extensively involved in developing.
