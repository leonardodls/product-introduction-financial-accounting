I qualified as an Electrical Engineer, with an electronic bias. I spent a few years in the Thyristor drive development laboratory of a major UK electrical equipment manufacturer, where I was responsible for the development of their small drives range. After that I was part of a start-up enterprise designing and manufacturing small electrical equipment including motor controls.

In the 1980s I joined Electro-Craft, one of the pioneers of brushless servomotor, providing application support for the European Sales activity. This involved evaluating proposed machine designs and recommending the correct servo components, including position controllers. It also involved on-site trouble-shooting. For a while I was also responsible for the design of some of the controllers and a range of small drives. Electro-Craft was eventually absorbed into Rockwell Automation, and I took over responsibility for the application support of Allen-Bradley Motion Control Products in Europe.

During this period I helped develop the Systex sizing tool used by Electro-Craft globally, and was later involved with the other authors in creating Motion Analyzer, the world class sizing and selection tool for Allen-Bradley.
