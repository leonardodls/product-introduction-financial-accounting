## Problem Definition

We will now use what we learned in Chapters 1 to 4 to create two months of Accounting Statements for State-to-State Consulting.

On June 1, Harry Nash opens a small business called State-to-State Consulting (STS) that helps people and small businesses install and set up their computers. He is the only stockholder in the corporation. He employs one secretary. He does all the consulting himself, and his only compensation is periodic dividend payments. He uses his personal truck as transportation and just charges the company for vehicle expenses.

Below is the process we will follow for creating Accounting Statements for June and July.

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR JUNE (Sections 5.2 â€“ Sections 5.8)
