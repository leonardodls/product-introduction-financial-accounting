### Assets

Core Fit owns a number of valuable things including cash in its bank account and workout equipment, such as free weights. These are all assets. Core Fit sells some of its classes for cash and some on credit. The amount of cash Core Fit is owed by customers that have bought on credit is categorized as Accounts Receivable and is also an asset.

### Liabilities

The money Core Fit owes to others, such as the monthly rent for the studio, fall in the Accounts Payable account. In addition, if Core Fit took out a loan to help buy some new machinery or open a new location, the dues of that loan would be a liability that would fall in the Notes Payable account.

### Stockholders’ Equity
