# Core Fitness pays $3,000 cash immediately to its landlord for January’s rent. Since this is a rent expense, net income decreases and therefore Retained Earnings decreases.  Expenses are shown as negative, as they are deductions that offset revenue and decrease net income.

**4. Purchase Supplies on Account**

*Retained Earnings* decreases (for expense incurred) AND *Accounts Payable* increases

*(Placeholder)*

# Core Fitness buys $1,000 of gym supplies that the vendor invoices now, but Core Fitness doesn’t pay until 30 days later. This increases the amount due or Account Payable by $1,000. This will decrease once Core Fitness pays the cash owed for the supplies. Since buying supplies is an expense, the expense Account changes by -$1,000.

*(Placeholder)*

![](./Chapter_1_Introduction_to_business_and_accounting_concepts/media/04_CommonAccountingTransactions/image9.png)

# Core Fitness pays cash for the $1,000 supplies it bought earlier but had not paid for.  Therefore, the cash account decreases by $1,000 and the Account Payable decreases by $1,000.

**6. Sell to Customers on Account**

*Accounts Receivable* increases AND *Retained Earnings* increases (for revenue generated)

*(Placeholder)*

![](./Chapter_1_Introduction_to_business_and_accounting_concepts/media/04_CommonAccountingTransactions/image11.png)

# Core Finess sells a 6-monthly membership for $500 so Revenue increases by $500.  Core Fitness invoices the customer now but receives cash later. Since the customer buys this on credit, Account Receivable increases by $500.

*(Placeholder)*

![](./Chapter_1_Introduction_to_business_and_accounting_concepts/media/04_CommonAccountingTransactions/image13.png)

# Core Fitness ultimately receives $500 in cash for the membership sold on credit.  Therefore Cash increases and Account Receivable decreases.
