Now we will use our understanding of common accounting transactions that we learned in <a routerlink='Chapter_1_Introduction/Common_Accounting_Transactions' class='ngx-router-link'>Section 1.4</a> to complete an accounting transactions grid.

### Interactive Exercise

**1. Complete the accounting transactions grid for the $4,000 investment transaction below.**

```
[cosmatt-widget]
 {"type":"assessment","options":{"id":"Chapter_1_Introduction/AccountingTransactionsGrid/test-Emded_01","data":{}}} 
```

**2. Complete the accounting transactions grid for the following transactions related to sales to customers. **

```
[cosmatt-widget]
 {"type":"assessment","options":{"id":"Chapter_1_Introduction/AccountingTransactionsGrid/test-Emded_02","data":{}}} 
```

**3. Complete the accounting transactions grid for the following transactions related to purchases from vendors.**

```
[cosmatt-widget]
 {"type":"assessment","options":{"id":"Chapter_1_Introduction/AccountingTransactionsGrid/test-Emded_03","data":{}}} 
```

**4. The following accounting transactions grid summarizes your entries from the previous three parts. Enter the totals for each account column in the last row.**

```
[cosmatt-widget]
 {"type":"assessment","options":{"id":"Chapter_1_Introduction/AccountingTransactionsGrid/test-Emded_04","data":{"meta":{"renderOverrides":{"widgetStyles":{"border":"1px solid #ddd","box-shadow":"none"},"horizontalAlignment":"center"}}}}} 
```

**5. Based on the correct entries for part 4, complete the closing entries and ending balances after closing.**

```
[cosmatt-widget]
 {"type":"assessment","options":{"id":"Chapter_1_Introduction/AccountingTransactionsGrid/test-Emded_05","data":{"meta":{"renderOverrides":{"widgetStyles":{"border":"1px solid #ddd","box-shadow":"none"},"horizontalAlignment":"center"}}}}} 
```

**The following grid shows an aggregated picture of all the transactions just completed. **

```
[cosmatt-widget]
 {"type":"spreadsheet-DLSleonardo-v2","options":{"data":{"itemId":"leo-leonardo-demo-388","meta":{"renderOverrides":{},"enableframeButton":true},"cssOverrides":{"div.cosmatt-widget":{"padding-top":0},"div.cosmatt-widget > div.leonardoPlayerContainer":{"padding-bottom":0}}}}} 
```

## Test Your Understanding 

Now fill in the below grid of common accounting transactions on your own.Â As in the Interactive Exercise, the accounting transaction for each row is on the left of the grid.

```
[cosmatt-widget]
 {"type":"assessment","options":{"id":"Chapter_1_Introduction/AccountingTransactionsGrid/test-Emded_06","data":{"meta":{"renderOverrides":{"widgetStyles":{"border":"1px solid #ddd","box-shadow":"none"},"horizontalAlignment":"center"}}}}} 
```
