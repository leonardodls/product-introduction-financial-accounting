## Introduction

A **business** is an organization that exists to make a profit by selling goods and/or services to customers.

The goal of a business is to make a profit through its operations. It does this by generating sales to customers that are greater in dollar amount than the costs associated with producing those sales in the same time period. If the costs are greater than the sales, the result is an operating loss.


```
[math]
\[Revenue\  > \ Costs\  = \ Profit\]
```


```
[math]
\[Revenue\  < \ Costs\  = \ Loss\]
```

Take the example of a fitness studio, Core Fit. Core Fit’s *revenue from membership fees and single-classes is approximately $30,000 per month.* Core Fit incurs a number of monthly costs such as the rent of the premises, the utilities (electricity and water), the maintenance of the equipment, insurance, and the salaries of its employees. *These costs total approximately $22,500 per month.* Therefore, **Core Fit’s revenue exceeds its costs by approximately *$7,500 per month*, and the business is profitable.**

Core Fit is a corporation. Stella and Eddie are the owners or stockholders. They invested $40,000 each in the business, which is the maximum amount they could lose if the business doesn’t do well and shuts down.

A service business sells expertise, advice, professional skills, or experiences rather than a physical product. Consultants, dry cleaners, airlines, attorneys, and repair shops are service-oriented businesses.

Core Fit is a services business. It sells unique fitness classes, which is an experience.

A business must keep track of its financial activities and summarize this information in reports for managers, investors, creditors, and tax reporting entities.

## What is Accounting?

**Accounting** is the system of analyzing, classifying, recording, summarizing, and interpreting business transactions. Accounting is often referred to as “**the language of business”** because it communicates valuable financial information for planning, making decisions, and evaluating performance.
