## Calculating Net Present Value & Sensitivity Analysis

Now that we have developed the annual cash flows of opening a new Core Fit location we can calculate the net present value.

We will also create a sensitivity table to show what happens to the net present value when we vary the discount rate and the monthly churn rate of members.

**Step 1**: Assume a discount rate of 15% and enter it into the spreadsheet in cell C4.

**Step 2:** Use the XNPV function to calculate the Net Present Value in cell C47.

\[Hint: Use the following [link](https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-xnpv-function) for a tutorial on the XNPV function\]

**Step 3**: Using the Data Table function, fill in the values for the sensitivity table to calculate NPV at different values for the discount rate and monthly membership churn rate.
