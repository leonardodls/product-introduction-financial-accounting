##### he accounting equation grid discussed in Section 1.4 displays the transactions in an easy-to-read format in terms of the accounts impacted and the related amounts. However, this layout becomes a bit cumbersome when a large number of transactions are involved. The accounting process is streamlined by instead using two record keeping processes for analyzing, classifying and recording transactions. These are the **journal** and the **ledger**.

Financial transactions are written down throughout the accounting period as they happen in a record book called the **journal.**  

This is a sample of a few rows in a journal. It has four columns:*  Date, Account, Debit, Credit.*

> In financial accounting, “Debit” indicates the left side of a ledger account and “Credit” indicates the right.

## Rules of Debit and Credit

When deciding if a journal entry should be in the debit or credit column we can use the following rule of thumb:

If an **ASSET** or **EXPENSE** is **INCREASING**, it goes in the **DEBIT** column.

If a **LIABILITY**, **STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY** or **REVENUE** is **INCREASING**, it goes in the **CREDIT** column.

If an **ASSET** or **EXPENSE** is **DECREASING** it goes in the **CREDIT** column.

If a **LIABILITY**, **STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY** or **REVENUE** is **DECREASING**, it goes in the **DEBIT** column, and vice versa.

For example, on September 1, Core Fitness paid $100 of cash for cleaning wipes to sanitize its gym equipment. In this transaction, cash decreases by $100 and supplies expense increases by $100. The Supplies Expense account increases so it goes in the Debit column and Cash decreases so it goes in the Credit column.

The next day, a new members join Core Fitness and pay $50 in monthly membership fees. Cash is increasing this time so it goes in the Debit column. Simultaneously, Revenue is increasing so it goes in the Credit column.

Whether an account’s amount should be entered in the debit column or the credit column is based on

  - Type of account

  - Whether the account is increasing or decreasing.

The following table summarizes the rules of debit and credit for commonly used accounts.
