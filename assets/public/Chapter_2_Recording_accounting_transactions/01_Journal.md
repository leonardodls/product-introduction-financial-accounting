##### The accounting equation grid discussed in <a routerlink='file:///C:\\Users\\Neelu_singh\\Dropbox\\Accounting%20Courseware\\Chapter_1_Introduction_to_business_and_accounting_concepts\\documents\\Chapter_1_Introduction\\Common_Accounting_Transactions' class='ngx-router-link'>Section 1.4</a> displays the transactions in an easy-to-read format in terms of the accounts impacted and the related amounts. However, this layout becomes a bit cumbersome when a large number of transactions are involved. The accounting process is streamlined by instead using two record keeping processes for analysing, classifying and recording transactions. These are the **journal** and the **ledger**.

Financial transactions are written down throughout the accounting period as they happen in a record book called the **journal.**  

This is a sample of a few rows in a journal. It has four columns:*  Date, Account, Debit, Credit.*

> The term **debit** refers to the **left** side of an account and **credit** refers to the **right** side of an account.

## Rules of Debit and Credit

When deciding if a journal entry should be in the debit or credit column we can use the following rule of thumb:

![](./Chapter_2_Recording_accounting_transactions/media/01_Journal/image3.png)

For example, on September 1, a new member joins Core Fitness and pays $50 in monthly membership fees. Cash is increasing so it goes in the Debit column. Revenue is also increasing so it goes in the Credit column.

**\[Insert 2.2.1\_rules1.xls**\]

![](./Chapter_2_Recording_accounting_transactions/media/01_Journal/image4.png)

The next day, Core Fitness pays $100 in cash for cleaning supplies to sanitize its gym equipment. In this transaction, Supplies Expense increases by $100 so it goes in the Credit column. Meanwhile, Cash decreases by $100 so it goes in the credit column.

**\[Insert 2.2.2\_rules2.xls\]**

Whether an account’s amount should be entered in the debit column or the credit column is based on

  - Type of account

  - Whether the account is increasing or decreasing.

The following table summarizes the rules of debit and credit for commonly used accounts.
