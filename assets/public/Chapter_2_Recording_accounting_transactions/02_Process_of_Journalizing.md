Entering transactions in the journal is called **journalizing** and involves the following steps:

1.  Select two (or more) accounts impacted by a transaction.

2.  Determine how much, in dollars, each account is affected. Amounts either are given or must be calculated based on information provided.

3.  Based on the rules of debit and credit, decide which account(s) is debited and which is credited.

4.  Enter the date on the first line of the transaction only.

5.  Enter the account that will be **debited** on the **first line** of the transaction. Enter its amount in the **Debit** column on the same line.

6.  Enter the account that will be **credited** on the **second line** of the transaction. **Indent** the credit account name, Enter its amount in the **Credit** column on the same line. 

The following journal excerpt for Core Fitness shows how sample transactions are entered.
