> The total of all the debit balances in a company’s ledger accounts must always equal the total of all the credit balances

A **trial balance** is a list of all a business’s accounts and its current ledger balances (copied over from the ledger accounts). A trial balance may be generated at any time to test whether total debits equals total credits. If both of the Total columns do not equal, there is an error that must be found and corrected.

Assume Core Fitness has only five accounts. \[It shows the ledger balances for the six transactions presented previously.\] The trial balance lists these accounts and their corresponding balances at the end of the month.

The trial balance shows that the ledgers balance:  $7,000 + $3,000 + $2,000 (debit balances) = $12,000 AND $1,000 + $11,000 (credit balances) = $12,000.
