For example, suppose the dumbbells that Core Fitness bought when they set up the gym need to be replaced after 5 years. We would say the useful life of the dumbbells is 5 years.

A transaction for depreciation occurs at the end of each accounting period during the asset’s useful life. It involves a debit to Depreciation Expense for the amount of the cost expired.

For example if the dumbbells cost $5,000 and depreciated at $1,000 per year for 5 years, then each year there would be a $1,000 *Depreciation Expense. *

Rather than crediting the asset account directly to reduce its value, a substitute account is used. That way the ledger balance of the fixed asset always remains at its full cost (such as $5,000 for the dumbbells).

> Accumulated Depreciation
> 
> For fixed assets, the account credited to record depreciation is Accumulated Depreciation. This is called a **contra asset** account and is intentionally the opposite of the normal balance for an asset – it has a credit balance in the ledger. **The debit balance of the asset account minus the credit balance of its associated Accumulated Depreciation contra account equals the asset’s book value**, or its current value to the business.

Transactions \#1 and \#2 show the end-of-period entries that expense off some of the cost of a fixed asset.

1.  Assume the dumbbells depreciate at a rate of $1,000 per year.
