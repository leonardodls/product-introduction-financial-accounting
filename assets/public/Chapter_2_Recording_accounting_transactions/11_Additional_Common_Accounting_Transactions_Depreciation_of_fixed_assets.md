LO: Journalize the periodic expiration of the cost of a fixed asset.

\[Notes Box\]

*“The process of "expensing off" the cost of a fixed asset as it is "used up" over the time it is used is **depreciation.”***

![](./Chapter_2_Recording_accounting_transactions/media/11_Additional_Common_Accounting_Transactions_Depreciation_of_fixed_assets/image2.png)

For example, suppose the dumbbells that Core Fitness bought when they set up the gym need to be replaced after 5 years. We would say the useful life of the dumbbells is 5 years.

A transaction for depreciation occurs at the end of each accounting period during the asset’s useful life. It involves a debit to Depreciation Expense for the amount of the cost expired.

For example if the dumbbells cost $5,000 and depreciated at $1,000 per year for 5 years, then each year there would be a $1,000 *Depreciation Expense. *

Rather than crediting the asset account directly to reduce its value, a substitute account is used. That way the ledger balance of the fixed asset always remains at its full cost (such as $5,000 for the dumbbells).

\[Notes Box\]

*“For fixed assets, the account credited to record depreciation is* Accumulated Depreciation*. This is called a **contra asset account** and is intentionally the opposite of the normal balance for an asset – it has a credit balance in the ledger. The debit balance of the asset account minus the credit balance of its associated* Accumulated Depreciation *contra account equals the asset’s book value, or its current value to the business.”*

Transactions \#1 and \#2 show the end-of-period entries that expense off some of the cost of a fixed asset.
