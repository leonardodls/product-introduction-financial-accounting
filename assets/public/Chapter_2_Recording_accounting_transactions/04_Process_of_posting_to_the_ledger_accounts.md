LO: Apply the series of steps for properly posting transactions to the ledgers.

The process of copying from the journal to the ledger is called **posting**. It is done one line at a time from the journal. A running total is then maintained for each account and is updated every time an amount is posted. Here are step-by-step instructions for posting each transaction.

1.  > Take note of the account name in the first line of the journal. Find that ledger account.

2.  > Copy the date from the journal to the first blank row in that ledger.

3.  > Leave the Item column blank in the ledger at this point.

4.  > Take note of the amount on the first line of the journal and the column it is in.

5.  > Copy that amount to the same column in the ledger on the same line where you entered the date.

6.  > Update the account’s running balance. Take note of any previous balance in the last two columns of the ledger.

<!-- end list -->

1.  > If there is no previous balance and the entry is a Debit (Credit), enter the same amount in the Debit (Credit) balance column.

2.  > If the previous balance is in the Debit (Credit) column and the entry is a Debit (Credit), add the two amounts and enter the total in the Debit (Credit) balance column.

3.  > If the previous balance is in the Debit (Credit) column and the entry is a Credit (Debit), subtract the credit (debit) amount from the balance and enter the difference in the Debit (Credit) balance column.

The example that follows shows a journal with six transactions that involve *Cash*. On each row where *Cash* appears in the journal, the amount on the same line is copied to the same column in the *Cash* ledger, in either the first Debit or the first Credit column. Superscripts \#1 through 6 are used here to match each posting. For example, the first debit to *Cash* in the journal for $1,000 is copied to the debit column in the ledger (\#1). The next time *Cash* appears in the journal is a debit for $6,000, so that is copied to the second debit column in the ledger (\#2).
