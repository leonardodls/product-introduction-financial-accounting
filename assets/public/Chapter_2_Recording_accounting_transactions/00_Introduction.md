While Chapter 1 taught us how individual accounts are impacted, in order to get insight into Core Fitness’s financial health, we need to look at a consolidated view of the fitness studio’s transactions. We use Core Fitness’ **financial statements** to get an aggregated picture of the company and can analyze if it is doing well, financially.

## Introducing the Accounting Cycle

The Accounting Cycle is a step-by-step process to identify, analyze and record the economic events of a company. The steps begin with identifying individual transactions by looking at source documents such as receipts, checks, invoices and bank statements. These transactions are similar to those outlined in Chapter 1 such as:

  - Core Fitness receives cash from an external investor when Stella and Eddie start the company.

  - Core Fitness pays rent for the month of March.

  - Core Fitness signs up 10 new members on January 2<sup>nd</sup>.

These individual transactions are converted into the Company’s summary financial statements through 6 steps outlined below.

Every company prepares these statements for specific time periods. The most common accounting period is annual, and therefore the accounting cycle would be for 1 year. However, statements can also be prepared monthly or quarterly. After each period ends, the Company restarts the 6 steps, and therefore the cycle repeats. This process of recording of transactions is known as the **Accounting Cycle.**

We completed the first step of **Identifying Transactions** in Chapter 1.

In Chapter 2, we will learn how to complete steps 2 and 3 which involve taking these transactions and recording them in two ways – **Journals and Ledgers.**
