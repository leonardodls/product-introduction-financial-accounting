1.  Core Fitness sells a membership to Frank for $100 and receives cash. When a business provides a service to a customer, the customer may immediately pay with cash.

```

2.  Core Fitness sells a membership to Maya and sends her an invoice for $200. Maya purchased a membership but has not paid for it yet.  Therefore, Core Fitness does not receive cash and the company’s Accounts Receivable increases.

> **Accounts Receivable** is an asset account that keeps track of how much customers owe because a business sent them invoices for goods or services rather than immediately receiving cash from them. This account is used as a **substitute for a debit to Cash** **when a company provides services to customers and bills them on account rather than receiving cash right away**. The expectation is that the customer will pay within a specified time period, usually 30 days.

3.  Core Fitness receives payment on account from Maya who had been invoiced for the membership sold to her on 6/1.
    
```

     {"type":"spreadsheet-DLSleonardo-v2","options":{"data":{"itemId":"leo-leonardo-demo-675","meta":{"renderOverrides":{},"enableframeButton":true},"cssOverrides":{"div.cosmatt-widget":{"padding-top":0},"div.cosmatt-widget > div.leonardoPlayerContainer":{"padding-bottom":0}}}}} 
```

Maya pays the invoice and the Core Fitness receives the cash payment, *Cash* is debited and *Accounts Receivable* is credited. Core Fitness’s *Accounts Receivable* balance becomes zero now that he Maya has paid in full. This is shown in the following *Accounts Receivable* ledger where transactions \#2 and 3 are posted.
