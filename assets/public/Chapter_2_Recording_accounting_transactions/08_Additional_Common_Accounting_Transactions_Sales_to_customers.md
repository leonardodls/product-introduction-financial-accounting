LO: Journalize additional transactions by applying the rules of debit and credit to additional business events

  - Journalize sales transactions both for cash and on account.

1.  Core Fitness sells a membership to Frank for $100 and receives cash. When a business provides a service to a customer, the customer may immediately pay with cash.

2.  Core Fitness sells a membership to Maya and sends her an invoice for $200. Maya purchased a membership but has not paid for it yet.  Therefore Core Fitness does not receive cash and the company’s Accounts Receivable increases.

*\[Notes Box\]*

*“*Accounts Receivable *is an asset account that keeps track of how much customers owe because a* *business sent them invoices for goods or services rather than immediately receiving cash from them. This account is used as a substitute for a debit to Cash when a company provides services to customers and bills them **on account** rather than receiving cash right away. The expectation is that the customer will pay within a specified time period, usually 30 days.”*

3.  Core Fitness receives payment on account from Maya who had been invoiced for the membership sold to her on 6/1.

Fitness’s *Accounts Receivable* balance becomes zero now that he Maya has paid in full. This is shown in the following *Accounts Receivable* ledger where transactions \#2 and \#3 are posted.
