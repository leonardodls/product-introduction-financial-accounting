The amount Core Fitness owes to Easy Clean is in the Accounts Payable account.  

*\[Notes Box\]*

*“*Accounts Payable *is a liability account that keeps track of how much a business owes because it was billed by vendors rather than immediately paying cash. A liability is a debt a business owes. The* Accounts Payable *account is used as a substitute for Cash when a business purchases something or receives a service from a vendor and does not pay cash immediately, but instead is billed on account (sent an invoice) and expected to pay in the future.”*

3\. Core Fitness pays Easy Clean on account for the invoice it received on 6/1.

```

When Core Fitness pays the invoice to Easy Clean, *Accounts Payable* is debited to decrease it and *Cash* is credited to decrease it. Core Fitness’ *Accounts Payable* balance becomes zero now that it has paid in full. This is shown in the following *Accounts Payable* ledger where transactions \#2 and \#3 are posted.
