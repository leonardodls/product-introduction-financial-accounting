2\. Core Fitness purchases floor cleaning supplies from Easy Clean to be used this month for $200 on account and receives an invoice from Easy Clean.

```

 {"type":"spreadsheet-DLSleonardo-v2","options":{"data":{"itemId":"leo-leonardo-demo-680","meta":{"renderOverrides":{},"enableframeButton":true},"cssOverrides":{"div.cosmatt-widget":{"padding-top":0},"div.cosmatt-widget > div.leonardoPlayerContainer":{"padding-bottom":0}}}}} 
```

The amount Core Fitness owes to Easy Clean is in the Accounts Payable account.  

> **Accounts Payable** is a liability account that keeps track of how much a business owes because it was billed by vendors rather than immediately paying cash. A liability is a debt a business owes. The Accounts Payable account is **used as a substitute for Cash when a business purchases something or receives a service from a vendor and does not pay cash immediately**, but instead is billed on account (sent an invoice) and expected to pay in the future.

3\. Core Fitness pays Easy Clean on account for the invoice it received on 6/1.

```

 {"type":"spreadsheet-DLSleonardo-v2","options":{"data":{"itemId":"leo-leonardo-demo-681","meta":{"renderOverrides":{},"enableframeButton":true},"cssOverrides":{"div.cosmatt-widget":{"padding-top":0},"div.cosmatt-widget > div.leonardoPlayerContainer":{"padding-bottom":0}}}}} 
```

When Core Fitness pays the invoice to Easy Clean, *Accounts Payable* is debited to decrease it and *Cash* is credited to decrease it. Core Fitness’ *Accounts Payable* balance becomes zero now that it has paid in full. This is shown in the following *Accounts Payable* ledger where transactions \#2 and \#3 are posted.
