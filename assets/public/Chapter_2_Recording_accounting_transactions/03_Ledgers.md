The **ledger** is the second accounting record book that is a list of a company’s individual accounts list ordered by account category. While the journal lists all types of transactions chronologically, the ledgers separate this same information out by account and keep a running balance for each of these accounts. 

\[Insert example diagram of how ledger converts to journal:

![](./Chapter_2_Recording_accounting_transactions/media/03_Ledgers/image2.tiff)

Each account has its own ledger page. The account name appears across the top. The ledger form has six columns: *Date, Item, Debit, Credit, Debit, Credit.* The first set of Debit and Credit columns are where amounts from the journal transactions are **copied**. The second set of Debit and Credit columns are where the account’s running total is maintained. An account’s **running balance** typically appears in either the Debit or the Credit column, but not both.

The following are sample ledgers for the **Cash** and **Fees Earned** accounts.
