The **ledger** is the second accounting record book. While the journal lists all types of transactions chronologically, the ledgers separate this same information out by account and keep a running balance for each of these accounts. For example, Cash is one account ledger, Accounts Receivable is another and so on.  Posting to the ledger from the journal is Step 3 of the Accounting Cycle.

Here is a description of the ledger using Core Fitness’ Cash and Fees Earned ledgers below:

① Each account has its own ledger page. The account name appears across the top.

② The ledger form has six columns: *Date, Item, Debit, Credit, Debit, Credit.*

The item column can be left blank or filled with the description of the activity.

③ The first set of Debit and Credit columns are where amounts from the journal transactions are **copied**.

④ The second set of Debit and Credit columns are where the account’s running total is maintained. An account’s **running balance** typically appears in either the Debit or the Credit column, but not both.
